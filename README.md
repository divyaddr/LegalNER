# **LegalNER: Named Entity Recognition for Legal Texts**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
LegalNER is a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system designed for processing legal documents. This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract key entities such as **case names, statutes, dates, organizations,** and other domain-specific terms. Built using **Python** and **SpaCy**, it provides a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and post-processing of extracted entities.  

---

## ⚙️ **Features**  
✔️ Preprocessing pipeline for legal text normalization  
✔️ Custom NER model trained on annotated legal datasets  
✔️ Integration with **SpaCy** for efficient entity extraction  
✔️ Configurable training and hyperparameters  
✔️ Post-processing utilities to refine extracted entities  
✔️ Support for **custom annotation formats**

## 🛠 **Technical Details**  
### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
- Tokenization and sentence segmentation  
- Cleaning and formatting legal text  
- Converting annotations into **SpaCy training format**  

### 2️⃣ **NER Model Training**  
- Utilizes **SpaCy’s transformer-based pipelines**  
- Configurable **hyperparameters** in `config.cfg`  
- Supports transfer learning with **pretrained embeddings**  

### 3️⃣ **Post-processing**  
- Rule-based corrections for extracted entities  
- Handling overlapping and misclassified entities
